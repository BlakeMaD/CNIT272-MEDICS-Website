			<p>Frank Tsai is in charge of getting the new medical insurance clearance system (MEDICS) on track for the
				city of Xiamen. The past iteration of the insurance system faced many issues regarding the inefficiency
				of cash transactions. The goal of the MEDICS e-clearance system is to simplify the medical supply chain
				and allow hospitals, banks, patients, and the insurance bureau to have seamless and cashless
				interactions. We are Xiban, an external consulting company looking to automate and enhance the prior
				medical insurance system in order to reduce costs, improve turnaround time, and improve claim
				throughput.</p>
