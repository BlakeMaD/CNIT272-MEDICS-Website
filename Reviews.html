			<h2>Review #3: Blaine Small</h2>
			<p><small>14th August 2020</small></p>
			<p>I had a hysteroscopy procedure today performed by Mr Cartmill. He was so kind and gentle and managed my anxiety in such an understanding manner whilst informing me of exactly what I needed to know. There were three nurses working alongside him and I would like to say a big thank you to all of them and Mr Cartmill - a great team.</p>
